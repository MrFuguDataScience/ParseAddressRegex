# Parse Personal Data with Regex:
This is a small project for learning basic Regex skills by parsing `personal` data consisting of `addresses`, `data of birth`, `social security number` to name a few. I create the data from `Faker`, therefore no *security* or *privacy* issues to deal with.

*Requirements*:
`pip instal Faker` | `import re` |
